# CODESOFT Internship Program - Task Overview

This repository contains three tasks completed as part of the internship program. Each task demonstrates a basic Python project using the Tkinter library for GUI-based applications.

## Task 1: Calculator
A simple calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Features:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Clear function for resetting calculations

## Task 2: Password Generator
A password generator that creates a random password of user-specified length. The password includes a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters for enhanced security.

### Features:
- Input field for specifying password length
- Randomly generates secure passwords
- GUI with a user-friendly interface

## Task 3: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
A classic rock, paper, scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The game uses Python's random module to make the computer's choice.

### Features:
- User input for selecting rock, paper, or scissors
- Random computer choice
- Displays the winner of each round

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install any necessary dependencies (Tkinter is usually included with Python).
3. Run each Python file (`calculator.py`, `password_generator.py`, `rock_paper_scissors.py`) individually.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/internship-tasks.git
cd internship-tasks
python task1_calculator.py
python task2_password_generator.py
python task3_rock_paper_scissors.py
